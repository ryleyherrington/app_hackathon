		First off, we all want to thank you for participating in our hackathon. Whether it be from developing an application, submitting an idea, or even coming to the final event, we want to thank you. It was an amazing event, and I know we all learned so much from this experience. 
    <p></p>
		Second, thank you to the judges that came out. This couldn't have happened without your help, and I know we all appreciate your input on each of our projects.

	<p class="iTtl">Judging Categories</p>
	<img src="/static/judges.JPG" alt="Judges" style="float:right; max-width:45%;">
    <p>
		We had four categories we judged each app on: 	
		 <ul>
            <li>Usefulness to User</li>
            <li>Most Commercial Potential</li>
            <li>App with the Largest User Base</li>
            <li>App Closest to Launch</li>
		</ul>
		We also had a people's choice award. Each team received $50 in prize money!

<article class="i" style="max-width:800px">
	<p class="iTtl">Usefulness to User</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The winner for this category was <b>Time Advisor</b>. Tim Chen, the creator, wanted to have an app that helped him with Time management. This app will give the ability for a user to identify their free and busy time and find solutinos to increase productivity. It will take your class schedule and a few other metrics, and produce a calendar for you to import into other mail protocols.

	<p class="iTtl">Most Commercial Potential</p>
	<img src="/static/ripe.JPG" alt="Ripe" style="float:left; max-height:30%;">
	<p>For the app that had most commercial potential, Nicole Phelps came up with <b>Just Ripe</b>.  After searching and selecting your produce item in JustRipe's search bar, you have easy access to the following information: ripe description (look, feel, smell, sound), taste, storage, cooking, recipes, nutrition, coupons (future version), and the ability to share to your social networks.

	<p class="iTtl">Largest User Base</p>
	<img src="/static/flatter.JPG" alt="Flatter" style="float:right; max-height:30%;">
	<p> The winner was Dean Johnson and his app <b>Flatter Me Please</b>. Basically this is a webapp that will compliment you when you visit the app. It has a large user base because it uses information on Facebook and you can post compliments to others as well.

	<p class="iTtl">Closest to Release</p>
	<img src="/static/notecard.jpg" alt="Flatter" style="float:left; max-height:30%;">
	<p> The winner was Carly Farr and her app <b>Notecard</b>. The judges loved this app because of its inherit simplicity but the market needed something like this. With this app you can create decks of flashcards and study on the go. With a front and back to each notecard, you can organize your "decks" for each class.

	<p class="iTtl">People's Choice</p>
	<img src="/static/rpsls.JPG" alt="RPSLS" style="float:right; max-height:30%">
	<p>
		For the People's Choice award, the winner was Jeff Wentz's app <b>RPSLZ- Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</b>. Based on the popular CBS show, Big Bang Theory, this app will basically let you play rock paper scissors with a slight variation. In future iterations it will let you play against people online instead of just on the single phone.

	<p class="iTtl">Judge's Choice</p>
	<img src="/static/djpi.JPG" alt="DJPi" style="float:left; max-height:20%">
	<p> Finally, the organizers got to choose their favorite app, and that was <b> DJPi</b>, made by Chris Vanderschuere. Based off the Raspberry Pi, this project crowd sources music playing and allows everyone at an event (on the same wifi network) to add music to a shared playlist. The concept uses an iOS app, a webserver, and a raspberry pi.
