	<p></p>
	<p class=iDes>
		The long term goal is to help undergrads in EECS to create product
		prototypes; this includes mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps,
		hardware-based, or even hybrids of the above.

	<p class="iTtl">About the Project</p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="iDes">
		This is the work of 3 Computer Science students studying at Oregon
		State University. We wanted to provide a way for people to submit
		all of their ideas in a centralized place and then get a prototype
		of those ideas out in the world.
	</p>
	<p class="iDes">
		The idea is that anyone can have the next big app or game or program
		idea but not have a way to implement it. This is a way for us to
		bring multiple fields of study into one place and hopefully produce
		some outstanding new apps.
	</p>
	<p class="iDes">
		For the first part of this project we will have the students submit
		their ideas and vote on projects. At the end of the term the
		projects with the most votes will be chosen for the implementation
		phase.
	</p>
	<p class="iDes">
		We will be having teams of about four programmers start to make the
		prototypes in Winter term. They will be presented in Spring term at
		the Kelley Engineering Center.
